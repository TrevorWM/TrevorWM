# Unity Roguelike Project

A sort of blog talking about what I've been working on in my Roguelike game.
Doing it in my spare time as a fulltime student, so progress will be kind of slow I just wanted a place to keep track of what I was
working on and learning about.

Decided to start my Godot project over in Unity becauase I wanted to get some experience with a more widely used engine.

So far I've gotten a basic PlayerController set up, and animated an attack. Can you tell I'm not an animator?

I found out that Unity had an updated Input Management system, and I wanted to swap my code over to that
as it looked easier to use and just kind of jived with my brain better. I didn't get around to implementing
the attack again yet, but I did add in a dodge. It's a little hard to see in the gif as there is no visual
indicators other than the speed of the character changing.

Spent a lot of time today going over the same code a bunch of times for the attack. Trying to figure out
the best way to handle things. I feel like I could have got some more actual progress done if I was being
more loose with my code architecture, but I haven't done many large projects before, and I want to make
the inevitable refactoring as easy as possible in the future.

Started working through the CodeMonkey Beginner Unity tutorial to get a better idea of how to properly
layout projects. It's been super helpful so far, and I was able to refactor things in a way where stuff
is more loosely coupled and easier to manage. Nothing really for visible progress, but I'm feeling better
about the project overall with the refactoring I've done.

Mostly creating events and better splitting code
between different scripts in order to keep things easier to read and maintain.
