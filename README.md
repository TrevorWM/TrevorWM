# Unity Roguelike Project

Decided to start my Godot proejct over in Unity becauase I wanted to get some experience with a more widely used engine.

So far I've gotten a basic PlayerController set up, and animated an attack. Can you tell I'm not an animator?

I found out that Unity had an updated Input Management system, and I wanted to swap my code over to that
as it looked easier to use and just kind of jived with my brain better. I didn't get around to implementing
the attack again yet, but I did add in a dodge. It's a little hard to see in the gif as there is no visual
indicators other than the speed of the character changing.

Spent a lot of time today going over the same code a bunch of times for the attack. Trying to figure out
the best way to handle things. I feel like I could have got some more actual progress done if I was being
more loose with my code architecture, but I haven't done many large projects before, and I want to make
the inevitable refactoring as easy as possible in the future.
