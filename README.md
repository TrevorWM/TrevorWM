# Unity Roguelike Project

A sort of blog talking about what I've been working on in my Roguelike game.
Doing it in my spare time as a fulltime student, so progress will be kind of slow I just wanted a place to keep track of what I was
working on and learning about.

Decided to start my Godot project over in Unity becauase I wanted to get some experience with a more widely used engine.

So far I've gotten a basic PlayerController set up, and animated an attack. Can you tell I'm not an animator?

I found out that Unity had an updated Input Management system, and I wanted to swap my code over to that
as it looked easier to use and just kind of jived with my brain better. I didn't get around to implementing
the attack again yet, but I did add in a dodge. It's a little hard to see in the gif as there is no visual
indicators other than the speed of the character changing.

Spent a lot of time today going over the same code a bunch of times for the attack. Trying to figure out
the best way to handle things. I feel like I could have got some more actual progress done if I was being
more loose with my code architecture, but I haven't done many large projects before, and I want to make
the inevitable refactoring as easy as possible in the future.

Started working through the CodeMonkey Beginner Unity tutorial to get a better idea of how to properly
layout projects. It's been super helpful so far, and I was able to refactor things in a way where stuff
is more loosely coupled and easier to manage. Nothing really for visible progress, but I'm feeling better
about the project overall with the refactoring I've done.

Mostly creating events and better splitting code
between different scripts in order to keep things easier to read and maintain.

Took a break for the weekend. Spent a fair bit of time today trying to do things the "best" way before
moving to just getting things working and then worrying about that stuff later. It's a lesson that I'm glad
I was able to learn relatively quickly because I was able to get some basic powerup items working and applying
buffs. Not quite the system I have in my head yet, but I'm getting a lot closer to what I have in my head.

I was pretty busy lately and haven't had the chance to work on things much. Today I got a few visual things done. I made my own sprites for the powerup icons,
  and I'm going to go back and make my own sprites for the character as well at some point. Currently I'm using the sprites from https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii.
  
I also followed a tutorial on how to do outlines using shader graph cause I tried to do something on my own and that was super out of my current knowledge. Shaders seem pretty cool though, and I'm interested to learn more about them. Probably something to focus on at a later time though. I wanna focus on getting a gameplay prototype going. We're slowly but surely getting there.
